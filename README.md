You will definitely encounter many tasks and goals in your life. They require time and energy. 😥

If too much, you will be overwhelmed, and tend to take care of one but not the other. 😵

Based on experience, my personal solution and habit is to divide tasks this way. 🍭

According to the **urgency and importance** of tasks, you can make four blocks. 📝

Then, **analyze and sort each block**. 👁‍🗨

Now start from **the first block** at top left and solve tasks **sequentially**. 👌

After finished first block, try to solve tasks of **top right and bottom left blocks alternated one by one**.  😋

Finally, just go and complete the block in the lower right area sequentially! 😄

If you have other tasks to join during the period, please just follow the principles above. 👍

Here's an demo you can refer to : 🎁

In this way, you can perform each task and goal efficiently and without omission. 😁
